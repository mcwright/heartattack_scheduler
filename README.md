#Heart-Attack-Scheduler

## Wut?
Collect and aggregate the ER wait times for the 3 majour hospitals in pi.  Graphs in the frontend shows a comparison of the various urgencies and adds in the drive time to the 3 locations.

## Why?
Cause the live data was there and PEI-DEVs had an open data hackathon in 2017.

## Where?

*./fronend*
User visible graphing and user distance calculations

*./backend
Persistence and API layer
